# Github Classroom

Throughout the year, you will demonstrate your understanding of complex programming techniques such as object-oriented programming by completing Github Classroom assignments.


## 1. Create a school Github account

To participate in Github Classroom, you will need to create a school Github account by signing up with your school Microsoft account. You may already have received an invitation from your teacher to your school email account, so please check in [Outlook Online](https://office.com/outlook).

**Note: Do not use a personal Github account**. If you forget your login details or your account, you may not have any recourse; by creating a school account, we may be able to help in case of a problem.


## 2. Accept your assignment

You can access your assignments by:

1. visiting [Github Classroom](https://classroom.github.com/) and finding the relevant assignment in the relevant class, or…

2. visit the assignment invitation link at the bottom of a lesson's ``.md`` file


## 3. Clone the assignment repository in Visual Studio Code

## 4. Commit your work regularly

As you work on the code contained in the assignments, be sure to commit your code. This is a record of what you changed.

1. In the sidebar, click on the Source Control icon (third icon down).
2. Under the Changes list, click the + next to files that you have modified and whose changes you wish to preserve.
