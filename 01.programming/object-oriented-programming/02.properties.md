# Properties

After creating a class, we can restrict what actions can be performed on its data. The benefit of this is that we fully understand what happens when a class' data is changed, how, and even why. In the example below, we modify the ``Student`` class to validate the following:

1. When changing a student's name, it must contain at least one character
2. When changing a student's age, it must be between the ages of 11 and 21

```python
from dataclasses import dataclass, field

@dataclass
class Student:
    """Personal information for a student"""
    # By convention, variables with underscores at the front
    # are not accessed directly by convention
    _name: str
    _age: int

    @property
    def name(self) -> str:
        return self._name

    @name.setter
    def name(self, new_name: str):
        # Validates that the name is non-empty
        # else raises an error
        if len(name) > 0:
            self._name = new_name
        else:
            raise ValueError("Name must contain at least one character")

    @property
    def age(self) -> int:
        return self._age

    @age.setter
    def age(self, age: int):
        # Validates that the age is within the correct range
        # else raises an error
        if age in range(11, 22):
            self._age = age
        else:
            raise ValueError("Age must be between 11 and 21")
```

## What's in a property?

As you can see, we create methods that do the following:

1. Protect the ``_name`` and ``_age`` variables from being accessed directly
2. Allow accessing the ``_name`` and ``_age`` safely through ``name()`` and ``age()`` methods
3. Allow changing the ``_name`` and ``_age`` **with validation** through the setter methods

But how does it actually do it?

## Protect the variables

To start with, we modify the names of the variables to include an underscore at the front. You will notice that ``name`` and ``age`` have become ``_name`` and ``_age``.

The underscore at the front is a signal to other Python developers that the variable should not be accessed directly; rather, fetching the value and changing it should be done through the use of a property.

## Getters and setters

### Getters

In order to validate the data when it is changed, we first need to define a special function that returns the value of the variable. This is called a **getter**: it *gets* the variable!

```python
@property
def name(self):
    return self._name
```

When dealing with objects, you don't need to call the getter like a function; it can behave like a variable.

```python
student = Student("Alan", 16)
print(student.name) # Alan
```

It's also possible to have getters perform custom behaviours. Say we store names with normal casing but want to easily retrieve the name in all upper case letters:

```python
@property
def name_upper(self):
    return self._name.upper()
```

```python
student = Student("Alan", 16)
print(student.name_upper) # ALAN
```

### Setters

The true magic happens in **setters**. Using setters, you can validate or run custom code when a variable's value is changed.

For instance, the following examples:

1. Validate that the name contains at least one character
2. Transforms all spaces to underscores
3. All of the above

```python
@name.setter
def name(self, new_name: str):
    if len(new_name) > 0:
        self._name = new_name
    else:
        raise ValueError("Name must contain at least one character")
```

```python
@name.setter
def name(self, new_name: str):
    self._name = new_name.replace(" ", "_")
```

```python
@name.setter
def name(self, new_name: str):
    if len(new_name) > 0:
        self._name = new_name.replace(" ", "_")
    else:
        raise ValueError("Name must contain at least one character")
```
