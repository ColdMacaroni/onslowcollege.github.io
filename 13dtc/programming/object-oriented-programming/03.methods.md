# Methods

## Learning intentions

You will learn:

- what a method is
  - when you should use one
  - how to declare an instance method

### Success criteria

You will know that you have completed the learning when:

- You have declared an instance method
- You have used an instance method on an object instance

# Methods

## What is a method?

In object-oriented programming, a **method** is a function that is attached to a class/object. Typically, methods operate on variables/constants stored within the class/object.

Methods exist in opposition to **free functions** which is what you have learnt so far. Free functions are not declared as part of a class.

## Examples

To explain methods, let's use an example: animals making sounds. Imagine we have a ``Duck`` class.

```python
@dataclass
class Duck:
    animal_sound = "Quack"
```

Suppose we have an instance of the ``Duck`` class and we want to make it quack. You could use a free function, ``print()``, like so:

```python
my_duck = Duck()
print(my_duck.animal_sound) # Quack
```

However, we can associate a function with the class that prints the message out for us. Here is the ``make_sound()`` method:

```python
@dataclass
class Duck:
    animal_sound = "Quack"

    def make_sound(self):
        print(self.animal_sound)

my_duck = Duck()
duck.make_sound() # Quack
```

### A special argument: ``self``

Notice the method's declaration. It accepts an argument, ``self``. Furthermore, ``self`` is used within the method definition.

The ``self`` argument is a reference to the object itself. It is how you can refer to other variables, constants, or methods within the object.

## Properties are functions

Just the same as functions, methods can:
1. modify variables
2. accept arguments
3. return values

### Modify variables

```python
@dataclass
class Duck:
    animal_sound = "Quack"

    # 1. Modify variables
    def set_animal_sound(self, new_sound):
        self.animal_sound = new_sound

    # 2. Accept arguments
    def make_sound(self, number_of_times=1):
        print(self.animal_sound * number_of_times)

    # 3. Return values
    def first_letter_of_animal_sound(self):
        return self.animal_sound[0]
```

## Properties are methods

Did you notice that [properties](02.members-and-properties.md) are also methods? Let's add an ``animal_sound`` property for the ``Duck`` class:

```python
@dataclass
class Duck:
    _animal_sound = "Quack"

    @property
    def animal_sound(self):
        return self._animal_sound

    @property.setter
    def animal_sound(self, new_sound):
        self._animal_sound = new_sound
```

Notice that the properties also contain the reference to ``self`` in the method declarations.
